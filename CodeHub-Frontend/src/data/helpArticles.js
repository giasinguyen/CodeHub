# Understanding Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting makes your code easier to read by coloring different parts of your code according to their function. CodeHub uses Monaco Editor (the same editor as VS Code) for the best highlighting experience.

## How It Works

### Automatic Detection
When you create a snippet, CodeHub automatically detects the programming language based on:
- File extension (if provided)
- Code patterns and keywords
- Manual selection from the language dropdown

### Supported Languages

CodeHub supports syntax highlighting for 50+ programming languages:

**Popular Languages:**
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- Java
- C/C++
- C#
- Go
- Rust
- PHP

**Web Technologies:**
- HTML
- CSS/SCSS/LESS
- React JSX
- Vue
- Angular

**Data & Config:**
- JSON
- YAML
- XML
- SQL
- GraphQL

**Shell & Scripts:**
- Bash
- PowerShell
- Batch

## Language Selection

### Manual Selection
1. Create or edit a snippet
2. Click the language dropdown (usually shows "Plain Text")
3. Search for your language
4. Select the appropriate option

### Best Practices
- Always select the correct language
- Use specific variants when available (e.g., "JavaScript React" instead of just "JavaScript")
- For config files, use the specific format (e.g., "JSON" not "Text")

## Code Formatting

### Indentation
Proper indentation improves readability:
- Use consistent spaces or tabs
- Follow language conventions
- CodeHub preserves your original formatting

### Comments
Comments are highlighted differently:
\`\`\`javascript
// Single-line comments appear in gray
/* Multi-line comments 
   are also highlighted */
\`\`\`

### Strings and Keywords
Different colors for different elements:
\`\`\`javascript
const message = "Hello World"; // keyword, variable, string
function greet(name) {         // function keyword
    return \`Hi, \${name}!\`;      // template literal
}
\`\`\`

## Advanced Features

### Code Folding
Long functions or blocks can be collapsed:
- Click the arrow next to line numbers
- Useful for organizing large snippets
- Helps focus on specific sections

### Minimap
For longer code snippets:
- Shows overview of entire file
- Quick navigation to different sections
- Highlights current viewport

### Error Detection
CodeHub highlights common syntax errors:
- Missing brackets or semicolons
- Undefined variables
- Type mismatches (in TypeScript)

## Troubleshooting

### Language Not Detected
If highlighting isn't working:
1. Check language selection in dropdown
2. Ensure code follows language syntax
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Contact support if issues persist

### Mixed Languages
For files with multiple languages:
- HTML with embedded CSS/JavaScript
- Markdown with code blocks
- Use the primary language for highlighting

### Custom Highlighting
For specialized formats:
- Use the closest supported language
- Add a note in the description
- Consider breaking into multiple snippets

## Tips for Better Highlighting

### JavaScript/TypeScript
\`\`\`javascript
// Use proper JSX for React components
function Component() {
    return <div>Hello World</div>;
}

// TypeScript types are highlighted
interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}
\`\`\`

### Python
\`\`\`python
# Proper function definitions
def calculate_total(items):
    """Calculate total price with tax."""
    return sum(item.price for item in items) * 1.08

# Class definitions
class User:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
\`\`\`

### CSS
\`\`\`css
/* Selectors and properties are highlighted */
.button {
    background-color: #007bff;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 4px;
    color: white;
    padding: 8px 16px;
}

/* Media queries */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .button {
        width: 100%;
    }
}
\`\`\`

Good syntax highlighting makes your code more readable and professional. Take advantage of CodeHub's powerful highlighting features to create snippets that are easy to understand and learn from!

# Organizing Snippets with Tags

Tags are the backbone of snippet organization on CodeHub. A well-thought-out tagging strategy makes your snippets discoverable and helps you build a organized code library.

## What Are Tags?

Tags are keywords that describe what your snippet does, what technologies it uses, and what problems it solves. They act as labels that help categorize and find content.

### Benefits of Good Tagging
- **Discoverability**: Others can find your snippets easily
- **Organization**: Group related snippets together
- **Search**: Filter and search your own collection
- **Community**: Connect with snippets on similar topics

## Tag Categories

### Language Tags
Always include the primary programming language:
\`\`\`
javascript, python, java, typescript, go, rust, php
\`\`\`

### Framework Tags
Add relevant frameworks and libraries:
\`\`\`
react, vue, angular, express, django, spring, laravel
\`\`\`

### Concept Tags
Describe what the snippet demonstrates:
\`\`\`
authentication, validation, async, hooks, middleware, api
\`\`\`

### Use Case Tags
Explain when to use the snippet:
\`\`\`
form-handling, file-upload, error-handling, testing, deployment
\`\`\`

### Difficulty Tags
Help others understand complexity:
\`\`\`
beginner, intermediate, advanced, tutorial, example, pattern
\`\`\`

## Tagging Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific and Relevant
**Good:**
\`react-hooks, useState, state-management\`

**Bad:**
\`code, programming, web\`

### 2. Use 3-7 Tags
- Too few: Hard to categorize
- Too many: Loses focus
- Sweet spot: 4-6 tags

### 3. Follow Conventions
Use commonly accepted tag names:
- \`javascript\` not \`js\`
- \`react-native\` not \`reactnative\`
- \`machine-learning\` not \`ml\`

### 4. Include Hierarchical Tags
Add both general and specific tags:
\`\`\`
database, sql, postgresql, query-optimization
\`\`\`

## Tag Examples by Category

### Frontend Development
\`\`\`javascript
// React Component Example
Tags: react, component, hooks, useState, typescript, ui

// CSS Animation
Tags: css, animation, keyframes, transition, responsive

// Vue.js Form
Tags: vue, form, validation, vuex, composition-api
\`\`\`

### Backend Development
\`\`\`python
// Django REST API
Tags: django, rest-api, serializers, authentication, python

// Express Middleware
Tags: express, middleware, authentication, jwt, node.js

// Database Query
Tags: sql, postgresql, join, optimization, query
\`\`\`

### DevOps & Tools
\`\`\`yaml
// Docker Configuration
Tags: docker, containerization, deployment, nginx, production

// GitHub Actions
Tags: ci-cd, github-actions, automation, testing, deployment

// AWS Lambda
Tags: aws, lambda, serverless, python, api-gateway
\`\`\`

## Advanced Tagging Strategies

### Namespace Tags
Use prefixes for organization:
\`\`\`
ui:button, ui:modal, ui:form
api:auth, api:users, api:posts
util:date, util:string, util:array
\`\`\`

### Version Tags
Track technology versions:
\`\`\`
react-18, node-20, python-3.11, typescript-5
\`\`\`

### Project Tags
Link snippets to specific projects:
\`\`\`
project:ecommerce, project:blog, project:dashboard
\`\`\`

### Status Tags
Indicate snippet status:
\`\`\`
work-in-progress, deprecated, updated, tested, production-ready
\`\`\`

## Tag Management

### Editing Tags
Update tags when:
- Technology versions change

### Long-tail Tags
Include specific combinations:
\`\`\`
react-custom-hooks, jwt-authentication-middleware, responsive-css-grid
\`\`\`

### Context Tags
Add environmental context:
\`\`\`
browser, node.js, mobile, desktop, server-side, client-side
\`\`\`

## Tag Hierarchy Examples

### React Development
\`\`\`
Level 1: react
Level 2: react-hooks, react-components, react-router
Level 3: useState, useEffect, custom-hooks, functional-components
Level 4: state-management, lifecycle, routing, context-api
\`\`\`

### Python Data Science
\`\`\`
Level 1: python
Level 2: data-science, machine-learning, pandas, numpy
Level 3: data-analysis, visualization, preprocessing, modeling
Level 4: feature-engineering, model-evaluation, data-cleaning
\`\`\`

## Common Tagging Mistakes

### Avoid These Pitfalls
1. **Over-tagging**: Using too many irrelevant tags
2. **Under-tagging**: Missing important descriptive tags
3. **Inconsistency**: Different formats for same concept
4. **Vague tags**: Generic terms that don't help
5. **Personal tags**: Tags only meaningful to you

### Tag Validation
Before publishing, ask:
- Would I search for these tags?
- Do they accurately describe the snippet?
- Are they commonly used terms?
- Do they follow community conventions?

## Tag Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
Schedule periodic tag reviews:
- Monthly tag audits
- Update deprecated tags

# Code Highlighting Not Working

Syntax highlighting makes code easier to read and understand. If your code isn't highlighting properly, this guide will help you troubleshoot and fix the issue.

## Common Causes

### Language Not Selected
The most common cause is not selecting the correct programming language:
- Check the language dropdown above the editor
- Ensure it matches your code type
- Select the specific variant when available

### Browser Issues
Sometimes browser problems prevent highlighting:
- Cached JavaScript files
- Browser extensions interfering
- Outdated browser version
- JavaScript disabled

### Code Format Issues
Improperly formatted code may not highlight:
- Syntax errors in the code
- Mixed languages in one snippet
- Special characters or encoding
- Very large code blocks

## Quick Fixes

### 1. Select Correct Language
1. Click the language dropdown (usually shows "Plain Text")
2. Type to search for your language
3. Select the exact match (e.g., "JavaScript React" vs "JavaScript")
4. Wait 2-3 seconds for highlighting to apply

### 2. Refresh the Page
Simple page refresh often resolves issues:
- Press F5 or Ctrl+R (Cmd+R on Mac)
- Wait for page to fully load
- Check if highlighting appears
- Try selecting language again

### 3. Clear Browser Cache
Cached files might be outdated:
- Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Choose "Last hour" or "Last 24 hours"
- Click "Clear data" and refresh page

## Detailed Troubleshooting

### Language Selection Issues

**Problem**: Can't find your language in dropdown
**Solutions**:
- Search using alternative names (e.g., "js" for JavaScript)
- Look for similar languages (e.g., "C++" instead of "cpp")
- Use parent language (e.g., "Text" for unknown formats)
- Contact support to add missing languages

**Problem**: Language selected but no highlighting
**Solutions**:
- Wait 5-10 seconds for processing
- Try a different language variant
- Check for syntax errors in your code
- Refresh page and try again

### Browser-Specific Issues

**Chrome/Edge**:
- Disable browser extensions temporarily
- Check Developer Tools console for errors
- Try incognito/private mode

- Document the mixed format in description

**Syntax Errors**:
Code with syntax errors may not highlight properly:
- Check for unclosed brackets or quotes
- Verify proper indentation
- Fix obvious syntax errors
- Use a local editor to validate syntax

## Advanced Solutions

### Editor Reset
If highlighting is completely broken:
1. Copy your code to clipboard
2. Clear the entire editor
3. Select language from dropdown
4. Paste code back
5. Check if highlighting returns

### Alternative Languages
If your specific language isn't working:
- Try a similar language (e.g., C for C++)
- Use a parent category (e.g., "Shell" for Bash)
- Select "Text" for basic formatting
- Add a note in description about actual language

### Code Block Size
Very large code blocks might not highlight:
- Split into smaller, focused snippets
- Remove unnecessary code sections
- Focus on the main logic
- Link to full code in external repository

## Prevention Tips

### Best Practices
- Always select language before pasting code
- Use consistent indentation (spaces or tabs)
- Validate syntax before publishing
- Keep snippets focused and concise

### Code Preparation
Before creating snippets:
- Test code in local environment
- Remove debugging statements
- Add helpful comments
- Format code consistently
